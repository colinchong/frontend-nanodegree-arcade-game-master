#Playing the game
The game starts with the player (represented by a sprite of a boy)at the center of the bottom of the map. You as the player must press Up, Down, Left, or Right to navigate your sprite. Each button press moves your sprite one space. The player must navigate to the top row of the river to win.

Between you and victory are bugs. If a bug and your boy make contact, the game will reset and you will have lost.

Winning also resets the game.
